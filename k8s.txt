The history of tea dates back to ancient China, almost 5,000 years ago. According to legend, in 2737 BC, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung was sitting beneath a tree while his servant boiled drinking water, when some leaves from the tree blew into the water. The emperor, a renowned herbalist, decided to try the infusion that his servant had accidentally created. The tree was a Camellia sinensis, and the resulting drink was what we now call tea. It is impossible to know whether there is any truth in this story. But tea drinking certainly became an established custom in China many centuries before it had even been heard of in the west. Containers of tea were shipped to the west much later.
