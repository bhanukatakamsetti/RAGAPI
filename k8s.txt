Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It automates deployment, scaling, self-healing, networking, and configuration management. Kubernetes was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).


Containers solve application packaging and dependency issues, but they do not handle multi-host scheduling, automatic restarts, traffic distribution, scaling, or high availability. Kubernetes solves these problems by continuously ensuring that the actual system state matches the desired state defined by the user.

Kubernetes Architecture Overview
Kubernetes follows a control plane and worker node architecture.

Control Plane Components
kube-apiserver
The API server is the entry point to the cluster. All components and users interact with the cluster through REST APIs exposed by the API server.

etcd
A distributed key-value store that holds the entire cluster state. It is the single source of truth for Kubernetes.

kube-scheduler
Responsible for assigning Pods to Nodes based on resource availability, constraints, affinity rules, and policies.

kube-controller-manager
Runs controllers that continuously monitor cluster state and take corrective action to reach the desired state.

Worker Node Components
kubelet
An agent running on each node that ensures containers described in Pod specifications are running.

Container Runtime
Executes containers. Common runtimes include containerd and CRI-O. Docker is not required.

kube-proxy
Handles network rules and enables communication between services and Pods.

Core Kubernetes Objects
Pod
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A Pod can contain one or more containers that share networking and storage. Pods are ephemeral and can be recreated at any time.

ReplicaSet
Ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times.

Deployment
Manages ReplicaSets and provides rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling. It is the preferred method for running stateless applications.

StatefulSet
Used for stateful workloads. Provides stable network identities and persistent storage. Commonly used for databases.

DaemonSet
Ensures that one Pod runs on each node. Typically used for logging, monitoring, and networking agents.

Job and CronJob
A Job runs a task until completion. A CronJob runs Jobs on a scheduled basis.

Kubernetes Networking
Service
Provides a stable virtual IP and DNS name for a group of Pods. Service types include ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

Ingress
Manages external HTTP and HTTPS access to services. Requires an Ingress Controller and supports routing, TLS termination, and host-based rules.

Configuration and Secrets
ConfigMap
Stores non-sensitive configuration data that can be injected into Pods as environment variables or files.

Secret
Stores sensitive information such as passwords and tokens. Data is base64 encoded by default and can integrate with external secret managers.

Scaling in Kubernetes
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
Automatically scales Pods based on metrics such as CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
Adjusts Pod resource requests and limits.

Cluster Autoscaler
Adds or removes nodes based on workload requirements.

Self-Healing Mechanisms
Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers, reschedules Pods on healthy nodes, replaces unhealthy Pods, and rolls back failed deployments.

Declarative Model
Kubernetes uses a declarative approach where users define the desired state using YAML manifests, and the system continuously works to maintain that state.

Docker vs Kubernetes
Docker is a container runtime for running containers on a single host. Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform designed for managing containers across multiple machines with scaling, self-healing, and networking capabilities.

Use Cases
Microservices architectures, CI/CD pipelines, cloud-native applications, hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, and high-availability systems.

Key Concepts
Desired state versus actual state, control loops, immutable infrastructure, infrastructure as code, and cloud-native design principles.

Production Best Practices
Use Deployments instead of standalone Pods. Define resource requests and limits. Use namespaces for isolation. Enable RBAC. Monitor with metrics and logging systems. Centralize logs and observability.

Mental Model
Kubernetes is a distributed system that continuously reconciles actual state to the desired state defined by the user.
